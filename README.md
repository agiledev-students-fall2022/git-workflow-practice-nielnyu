The article titled "What Makes A Good Programmer", is a very intresting article that discussed five key skills that makes up a good programmer. These skills are problem decomposition, scenario analysis, naming, consistency and learning. Two things that I found very intresting is the concpet of problem decomposition and learning. Problem decomposition is the skill of problem solving by breaking larger problems into smaller and smaller task that can be accomplished which will inevitable lead to the entire problem being solved. I think this intresting because it really can help developers find clear solutions using the scrum framework that breaks problem down into daily tasks. Learning is a skill that many good porgammer has because as software developers we are constantly learning new technologies and techniques. The constant thirst for knowledge is a great assest for programmers since it can lead to much more efficent solutions to important problems.

My biggest insight from the article is the naming. While we focus mostly on hard skills to get better as devs, we skip over the soft skills that are essential for great collaboration.

This is a very interesting article because most people think that being a programmer is just knowing how to code. Although learning how to code is an essential skill for a programmer, programmers that have these other skills mentioned in the article -- problem decomposition, scenario analysis, naming, consistency and learning -- are more sucessful and are even able to learn new programming languages easier.
